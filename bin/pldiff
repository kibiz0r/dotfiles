## @file
## Shows CLI diff between two plist files.
##
## Normally, Mac plist files are binary, so diffs do not display. However,
## there are cases where seeing diffs is important. For example, when tracking
## changes via Mackup's git storage option.
##
## Note this option allows seeing plist diffs without fully installing Xcode
## tools (otherwise, Xcode tools enables opendiff, which may be a better
## alternative).
##
## Note I prefer to emulate the look and feel of git's default diff, so this
## script uses the '+/-' diff option, less for vi-like viewing, and supports
## the colordiff binary if installed.
##
## To install colordiff:
## @code
## // On Mac:
## brew install colordiff
## // On Debian or Ubuntu:
## sudo apt-get install colordiff
## @endcode

## Example: 
## @code
## ./pldiff PATH/TO/a.plist PATH/TO/b.plist <ARGS>
## @endcode
## Where <ARGS> are any additional diff args.

a=$(plutil -convert xml1 -o - "$1")
b=$(plutil -convert xml1 -o - "$2")

# The -u flag displays line numbers with "+" and "-" (rather than ">" and "<").
# The optional colordiff binary defaults to green/red.
# Less -R is used to emulate vi.
if [ which colordiff &> /dev/null ]; then
  diff -u =(echo "$a") =(echo "$b") "${@:3}" | colordiff | less -R
else
  diff -u =(echo "$a") =(echo "$b") "${@:3}" | less -R
fi
